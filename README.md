Javascript Front-end Projects

To view these files, use a Node.js terminal and type the following commands:

create-react-app ./

This will create the node_modules folder. You can create a blank project, then paste the files here over the default files.

npm start ./

This will start the project. For any questions, feel free to contact me on my website, or on one of my social media platforms.
